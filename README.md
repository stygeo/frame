# frame.js

Frame is an extensive framework for the web written in JavaScript based on Objective-C
and Apple's UIKit framework. While not identical it's heavily inspired by Apple's API
design philosophy.

## Word of caution

Frame.js is still in heavy development and therefor it's recommended you
use frame for testing only. The documentation is ever changing and so
is the API. Please don't get frustrated or annoyed I'm still fiddling
with the overall API design. Please refer to the documentation (which
might be outdated!) or check out the samples (always up to date!).
